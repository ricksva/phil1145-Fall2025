## What are the course texts and other materials?

Buy the PRINT editions of these texts (either from the campus bookstore
in the Curry Student Center, or elsewhere). We'll use the PRINT
editions, not the ebook editions, of these books. **If buying them will
be a financial hardship, then please talk to me right away.**

ALWAYS bring the materials that were assigned for that day's class, to that
day's class!

1.  [Ethics for people who work in tech]{.underline}, Marc Steen
    (paperback, CRC Press 2023)

2.  [The Right To Oblivion]{.underline}, Lowry Pressly (Harvard
    University Press 2024)

    course Canvas site and this site]

## What other stuff do I need to have for this course?

If you have a copy of the required course materials; a reliable and strong
Internet connection; a tablet/computer for accessing websites, email, and Canvas;
and something to write on and write with during class, then
you have the material stuff that you need!
