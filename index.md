## What's this course about?

This course treats technological systems (such as social media tools,
"surveillance tech", and artificial intelligence systems) as **tools for
exploring questions in ethics and in philosophy more broadly**. Our
answers to those questions have implications for whether and how we
should design, make, use, understand, and respond to technologies and
technological systems. The course uses various philosophical concepts
and tools, developed within a variety of intellectual and cultural
traditions.

This course asks: How *should* our moral and political values shape --
and be shaped by -- our technologies? How can we best achieve
technologies' promises, while preventing, minimizing, or more fairly
distributing their harms? We can't answer those questions without
noticing that our technologies embody various philosophical and
sociopolitical choices about things like *well-being*, *autonomy*,
*health*, and *meaning*. This course is, fundamentally, about those
things.

## What will I get from this course?

Like most philosophy courses, this one involves "thinking in slow
motion": taking everyday and often-unquestioned ideas, practices, and
values, and examining them creatively, carefully, and thoughtfully.
That's sometimes called "critical thinking", but *every* academic
discipline can teach you critical thinking! Philosophy is critical
thinking freed of several of the boundaries that define other
disciplines. You'll get better at that.]
**The course's *general* goals are (a) to introduce you to ethical and
sociopolitical implications of some technologies and (b) to show you how
to apply philosophical thinking to your (and others') responses to those
implications.** You should be able to:

- **Demonstrate** orally and in writing your understanding of
  philosophical questions raised by and related to topics such as
  privacy, attention, and artificial intelligence

- Clearly and accurately **explain** important philosophical and
  ethical concepts, such as normativity, well-being, autonomy, and moral
  virtues

- Accurately and charitably **summarize and analyze** others' arguments
  for their presuppositions, strength, consistency, and
  implications

- **Make** **and** **improve** your own thoughtful, well-supported, and
  clearly expressed perspectives on the ethical and sociopolitical
  dimensions of technologies

- **Engage** your classmates, instructor, and others in thoughtful and
  constructive discussions about the philosophy of technology

- **Apply** what you have learned in this course to your life as a
  member of a society that designs, uses, and is affected by all kinds
  of technologies


## What should I do BEFORE our class meetings? 

- Make time to read the assigned materials and then read them. Try your
  best to find time when you're awake, alert, and won't be interrupted.
  Don't speed read; go slowly (unless I've specifically suggested that
  you skim). Ty to identify the author's main claims and the reasons and
  examples given to support those claims. Look up unfamiliar words or
  phrases and write their definitions in your notes. If you find that
  your eyes are just passing over the words, then stop and come back
  later.

- Be prepared to read the assigned materials more than once. Philosophy
  can be hard to read, so you should expect to be confused about some or
  much of that reading! But don't fall back on, "I have no idea what
  they're saying". Instead, try to figure out why you're confused. Write
  down your questions in your notebook, so that you can come to class
  prepared to discuss them.

- Next, **read the google doc Prep document for that day's class, and
  annotate it where you see fit**. The Prep document is meant to clarify
  the reading and prepare us for a good class meeting. See below for
  more details.

- Next, bring the assigned materials with you to class. Be ready to
  talk together and think together. Before you get to class, do
  something that helps you focus (some light calisthenics, or some
  meditation, or a snack), if at all possible.

- Note: **Don't come to class if you don't feel well or have recently
  tested positive for covid-19**, and please wear a mask to class during
  the first week of the semester. (The university forbids faculty from
  *requiring* masks, but I'm *asking* that you wear one during that time
  and whenever else you want to. Airborne viruses, unfortunately, aren't
  "over".)
