## What's this course about?

This course treats technological systems (such as social media tools,
"surveillance tech", and artificial intelligence systems) as **tools for
exploring questions in ethics and in philosophy more broadly**. Our
answers to those questions have implications for whether and how we
should design, make, use, understand, and respond to technologies and
technological systems. The course uses various philosophical concepts
and tools, developed within a variety of intellectual and cultural
traditions.

This course asks:
* How *should* our moral and political values shape --
and be shaped by -- our technologies?
* How can we best achieve
technologies' promises, while preventing, minimizing, or more fairly
distributing their harms?

We can't answer those questions without
noticing that our technologies embody various philosophical and
sociopolitical choices about things like *well-being*, *autonomy*,
*health*, and *meaning*. This course is, fundamentally, about those
things.

## Course Materials and Communication

There are three primary sources of communication for this course:

This website. This is where you will find announcements, policies, course assignments, and reading materials.
Canvas. That's where you will submit the course assignments and get my comments on them. That's also where you'll see your grades for the assignments, and the gradebook.
Discord. Please join at ___. Note you must set your Display Name for the server to your full name before you will be given access to private course channels. This will be a place for any discussion that are not direct questions about homework (which should take place on Pawtograder). Discord will also be used for lab communication (each lab will have a private channel), for announcements about the course. For any questions that are not specifically about homework.
Note that we will not use Canvas for anything other than uploading the course assignments.
