## What's this course about?

This course treats technological systems (such as social media tools,
"surveillance tech", and artificial intelligence systems) as **tools for
exploring questions in ethics and in philosophy more broadly**. Our
answers to those questions have implications for whether and how we
should design, make, use, understand, and respond to technologies and
technological systems. The course uses various philosophical concepts
and tools, developed within a variety of intellectual and cultural
traditions.

This course asks:
* How *should* our moral and political values shape --
and be shaped by -- our technologies?
* How can we best achieve
technologies' promises, while preventing, minimizing, or more fairly
distributing their harms?

We can't answer those questions without
noticing that our technologies embody various philosophical and
sociopolitical choices about things like *well-being*, *autonomy*,
*health*, and *meaning*. This course is, fundamentally, about those
things.
