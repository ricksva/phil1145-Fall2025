# What kinds of assignments will we have in this course?

The assignments are listed below and described more fully in a separate
document ("Course Assignments"). That document is also part of the
syllabus. Research about learning strongly suggests[^2] that the most
important factor in learning is doing the work of practicing, recalling,
synthesizing, and analyzing. The assignments are designed to help with
that.
