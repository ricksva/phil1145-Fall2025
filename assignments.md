# What kinds of assignments will we have in this course?

The assignments are listed below and described more fully in a separate
document ("Course Assignments"). That document is also part of the
syllabus. Research about learning strongly suggests[^2] that the most
important factor in learning is doing the work of practicing, recalling,
synthesizing, and analyzing. The assignments are designed to help with
that.

1. First week reflection

1. Writing Assignments: Reading Responses (2), Podcast Analysis (1)

1. Socratic Circle memos (10)

1. Prep document annotations (20)

1. In-Class activities (ICAs) (20)

1. Concluding Assignment (Project Paper or Viva)

# **First-week Reflection - due by 9pm Thursday 16 January**

First, **think about, and write down answers to**, at least two of the
following questions.

1.  What name (and if relevant to you, pronouns) do you want me to refer
    to you by?

2.  What is a *technology*? (How do you, personally, define that word?)

3.  What are some *values* that are most important to you? (Identify
    five at most, and explain them.)

4.  What is an example of a *non-digital* technology that you think
    helps us to live better lives, whatever you mean by "us" and
    "better"?

Second, please **record a short (three minutes or less) audio or video
summarizing what you wrote down**. Your recording doesn't have to
duplicate exactly what you wrote. The writing serves as a guide to get
you thinking before you record. The recording doesn't need any special
audio or video effects! It can be as simple or as complex as you want.

# 

# **Prep Document Annotation (x 20)**

I write Prep documents for each class meeting (starting with Wednesday
08 January's class) and make them available on the course Canvas site at
least 2 days before that day's class. You need to make **at least 1**
thoughtful annotation in the Prep document for that day -- a comment,
question, or reply to someone else's annotations -- BEFORE 9 am that
day.

For example: the Prep document for Monday 27 January's class will be
available no later than Saturday 25 January. Your annotation for that
day's class will be due before 9 am Monday 27 January.

I assess your annotation as either Pass/"Complete" (you did at least the
minimum before the deadline) or Fail/"Incomplete" (you didn't do at
least the minimum before the deadline, or you did it *very* weakly).

You can't submit an annotation after the deadline or redo it if it
doesn't pass.

# **Class Attendance**

"Class attendance" means that you attend our scheduled class meetings,
fully and constructively. "Fully" means that (a) you are on time; (b)
you are not doing some other task, such as work for another course; and
(c) you're well prepared for that day's class by having read all of the
assigned materials completely and at least once before that day's class.
"Constructively" means that your in-class behavior and comments show
respectful engagement.

As I noted in the main syllabus document, you should put your phone away
and you should use any other digital devices as sparingly as possible.
*Briefly* unlock/open your device to make a note, then lock/close the
device.

If you're sick or in some other situation that might affect your class
attendance, then you don't need to give me details, but let me know as
soon as you can.

What's so great about attending class, anyway? Professor Margaret Soltan
(Dept. of English, George Washington University) offers a rationale and
an ideal.

> Where will the discussion... go? Lots of places. Unexpected places.
> The professor has a sort of lesson plan, to be sure, but she's eager
> to follow the windings of her students' minds... to let them find
> truths in their own ways, rather than have those truths pre-packaged.
> Pre-packaged is efficient, but no real mental activity, no real-time
> shaping of one's own thought and discovery of the world on one's own
> terms takes place.
>
> ...The classroom is the drama of the live mind and body in a buzzing
> world of other minds and bodies, all generating heat and light
> together in a vaguely known, but also excitingly open and unknown, way
> ("Where Do Professors Come From?", at
> [[http://www.margaretsoltan.com/?p=48631]{.underline}](http://www.margaretsoltan.com/?p=48631),
> accessed 04 May 2024).

# 

# **In-Class Activity (x 20)**

During most class meetings, you'll do small-group activities and/or
writing for us to discuss during class. I assess them as either Pass
("Complete") (you answered all of the questions and, if relevant, turned
in your answers) or Fail ("Incomplete") (you didn't, or you didn't them
very weakly). You can't submit an In-Class Activity assignment on your
own or after that day's class, and you cannot redo it if it doesn't
pass.

# **Socratic Circle memos (x 10) -- due before 9p most Wednesdays, as indicated on the course Canvas site**

This assignment's purpose is to help you collaboratively engage with the
readings, through discussions in which you ask open-ended questions,
listen closely to each other, and build on each other's thoughts.

You'll be a part of a "Socratic circle" with 2 or 3 other students from
this section. (The circles were randomly created in Canvas. **If there
be anyone in the class you already know you don't want to do this
assignment with, then let me know as soon as possible and I'll do my
best to put you in different circles!)**

Starting in week 3, **you'll meet in person during our Wednesday class
times, ten times throughout the semester, for 45 -- 60 minutes each
time**. Find a place where you can have a conversation without
disturbing others. The meetings *must* be synchronous, but you may meet
remotely if someone in your group is contagious.

*BEFORE the meeting, everyone in a Socratic circle must agree about
which of the assigned materials from that week's Monday or Thursday
classes to discuss.* For instance, it could be a single chapter or
multiple chapters. You can run the circles as you'd like: share all your
notes in a single doc; have a different person lead each week's
discussion (where that leader has put some extra work into preparing);
etc.

During these meetings, clarify your understanding of whichever readings
you chose; answer the following questions, and come up with other
questions to answer:

- Is there a problem the author discusses or tries to solve? If so, then
  what?

- How would we reconstruct their main points and arguments in
  premise-conclusion form?

- What do we (a) not understand or (b) not feel sure about or (c) find
  thought-provoking for some other/additional reasons?

You might come to a clearer idea of your own views then, but it's fine
if you don't: the class discussion on Thursday might help you!

After each of your meetings, and before the deadline, submit a Socratic
memo of between 500 -- 800 words, **written in complete sentences**,
that includes **all** of the following elements:

- Which members were there? Which ones wasn't?

- When did your meeting begin and end?

- Who was supposed to do what? (Your *planned* pre-meeting division of
  labor)

- Which parts of the reading did you discuss? What resulted? (For
  example, new clarifications, new insights, surprising areas of
  agreement)

- What would be a good question for the class to discuss? (Must be
  closely tied to the reading(s) you discussed, and take one of the
  following forms:

  - *Interpretative*: "On page \[p\], \[Author\] writes \[bla bla
    blah\]. We *think* that \[bla bla blah\] means \[possible
    interpretation\], but we're unsure because of \[reasons you're
    unsure\]. Why does it matter how we interpret \[bla bla blah\]? It
    matters because of \[reasons that it matters in the broader
    context\]. Given what we've explained, what do *you* think is the
    best way to interpret \[bla bla blah\] in context?"

  - *Other*: You can pose a different kind of reading-related question
    for the class to discuss, as long as you explain your question
    clearly and explain what's at stake -- i.e., why you have that
    question and why the answers to that question matter.)

This is an assignment for which everyone in the circle has equal
responsibility. Please tell me as soon as possible about any intragroup
problems you're having.

Your get an individual *initial* "Pass" on a Socratic Circle memo only
if it includes **all** the elements listed above. This isn't one of the
assignments that you can revise and resubmit, so please make the time to
check it carefully!

Near the end of the term, you'll give me anonymous evaluations of the
preparation, attendance, engagement, and contributions of everyone
(including you yourself) in your circle. **Your individual *final*
Socratic Circle memo grade, for one or more memos, might change as a
result of that feedback.**

# **Reading Response (x 2) -- due Thursday 06 February and Thursday 13 March**

The reading response assignment is a way to show your understanding of
the course materials; improve your abilities to assess and evaluate the
arguments contained in those materials; and formulate fruitful questions
for discussion. Practicing those things can also be helpful for the
Podcast Analysis assignment and for the Concluding assignment.

***How To Write A Reading Response***

- **Your first reading response must be about one of the assigned
  readings from the first four weeks of the course.**

- **For your second reading response, choose one of the assigned
  readings from the first ten weeks of the course, different from what
  you chose for your first reading response.**

- Write a response of between 600 -- 1000 words that includes all three
  parts listed below. Each part must be written completely in your own
  words, **with each part clearly labeled**. It is okay to exceed the
  listed limits in each section below by a *few* (10 - 15) words.

> 1\. Summary (200 - 500 words) *This section is for summarizing only,
> not for editorializing.* In this section, summarize what you think are
> either the author's **main points** or their main **arguments**
> (premises plus conclusion). To do that, imagine yourself *accurately*
> explaining the material to someone who doesn't already know it.
> Provide page citations of the parts that you're summarizing. Unless
> you and the author know each other personally, then you must refer to
> them by their last name: for example, "Biles", not "Simone".
>
> 2\. Reaction (300 - 450 words) This section should present *your own*
> well-articulated responses, NOT a summary. Provide a thoughtful and
> engaged analysis of the material. You might, for instance, write about
> what you found persuasive or unclear about the author's view; or how
> the material connects to other class readings or discussions; or its
> connection to other courses or other parts of your life.
>
> Avoid writing, "The author ignores/fails to consider \[some point\]".
> You don't have access to that person's mind, and you don't know what
> they have or haven't considered. For similar reasons, avoid writing,
> "The author needs to say more about \[topic\] or \[topic\]." The
> author probably *has* said more about those topics elsewhere; you just
> haven't read or heard those things (yet)! However, you can certainly
> point out when an author provides insufficient support for something
> that they *do* say, as long as you also explain what kind of evidence
> *would* provide such support.
>
> 3\. Discussion Question (1 - 2 sentences) In this section, you pose
> one brief, open-ended question, *directly connected to that reading*,
> that might be the basis of a *good* class discussion. Your idea for a
> question can be based on something you already mentioned in the
> Reaction section.
>
> Here are some features of discussion questions that *aren't* good:

- Your question requires background knowledge that most of your
  classmates aren't likely to have ("What do you think of Section 587 of
  the Smith Act?")

- Your question is really three or four questions crammed into a single
  phrase ("What do you think of the Smith Act, and what could we do to
  make people understand it, and why is it hard for people to talk about
  it?")

- Your question is a simplistic yes/no question or some other question
  that most of your classmates can answer without much thought ("Are
  there some good aspects of social media?")

<!-- -->

- Please include the title and author name of the material, plus your
  name, in the document or file itself!

**Audio/Video Option**: You may upload/submit a Reading Response as a
recorded audio or video file, rather than as a written document.
However, all the same format requirements and other criteria apply.
Also, if you submit a recording, you must practice beforehand, so that
your delivery is polished and clear. Speak clearly and conversationally,
not mumbling or in a monotone.

**Hint for Reading Responses**: I strongly recommend using David
Concepción's essay, "How to Write Philosophy", as a guide. That essay
describes a three-part reading process for philosophical materials. As
part of that process, a reader (e.g., you) will come up with questions
about those materials!

**You must receive a "High Pass" or "Pass" on a Reading Response, in
order to get credit for the assignment.** You get a "High Pass" or
"Pass" on a Reading Response only if it meets all the criteria below.

+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **High Pass**  | **Your response follows the stated format (including       |
|                | length requirements).**                                    |

|                | **Your Summary section is not just accurate but shows a    |
|                | *strong* grasp on the material being summarized,           |
|                | demonstrating awareness of the central ideas and of ones   |
|                | that are less central.**                                   |

|                | material. If it raises criticisms, those criticisms are    |

|                | might be more than one plausible way of answering it; and  |
|                | it generates additional questions that could move a        |
|                | conversation forward.**                                    |
+================+============================================================+

|                |                                                            |
|                | **Your Summary section is mostly accurate, showing a good  |
|                | awareness of which parts of the material are central and   |

# **Podcast Episode Analysis -- due Thursday 20 March**

There is *far* more to learn about the interplay between ethics,
politics, societies, and technologies than this course can cover. The
podcast episode analysis assignment is a way for you to explore some of
the perspectives, topics, or questions that this course might not cover
(or might not cover extensively). Additionally, the assignment is
another way for you to practice and demonstrate your skills at careful
listening; accurate and charitable assessment of other people's views;
and creative synthesis of multiple perspectives. Practicing those skills
can also be helpful for our in-class conversations, the Socratic Circle
meetings, the Prep document annotations, and the Concluding assignment.

**For the Podcast Episode Analyses, you can either fill out and submit a
Podcast Episode Analysis Worksheet OR write your analysis in a standard
essay-ish form.**

***How To Write A Podcast Episode Analysis***

*Preparation:*

1.  Pick only one podcast EPISODE from the one of the podcasts listed
    below. Click on the link to go to that podcast's website, where
    you'll be able to see the available episodes, and pick one to listen
    to.

2.  Listen to your selection completely and at least twice. This means:
    you should listen to the *entire* episode, twice. Listening to it
    more than twice is even better: you'll undoubtedly notice things
    that you missed earlier!

3.  Take "timestamp notes" as you listen. This means: pay careful
    attention to the elapsed time. When you hear a name, idea, question,
    explanation -- when you hear anything that you'll need to refer to
    later -- notice when that segment begins and when it ends. (Here is
    a made-up example: if Shuri's amazing comment begins at 4 minutes 33
    seconds into the episode, then mark that in your notes, summarize
    the amazing comment, and write in your notes the time when her
    amazing comment ends.)

4.  When the episode is over, review your notes and then listen to the
    episode again, making whatever additional notes might be useful.

*Podcast Episode Analysis Writing (Mechanics):*

5.  Using a font size between 11 and 14 points, write an analysis
    (approximately 800 - 1200 words long, plus or minus 25 words) that
    addresses the questions listed below. Include your name, podcast,
    and episode title in the document, but that doesn't count towards
    the word total. (Or: speaking at a normal rate of speed, make your
    analysis as an audio/video recording of approximately 4 - 8 minutes,
    plus or minus 30 seconds. In your recording, briefly state your
    name, podcast, and episode title, but that doesn't count towards the
    total duration.)

6.  Your analysis may, ***but does not necessarily need to***, discuss
    the entire episode. It may instead focus on one part, but if so,
    then it must explain the context of that part -- how it's related to
    the previous parts and to the subsequent parts of the episode.

7.  You do not need to make a bibliography for this assignment. However,
    you do need to use timestamps to cite whatever segments you're
    referring to or quoting. For example, if I listened to the
    "Vibranium Today" podcast, and I wanted to talk about how amazing
    Shuri's comment was, I'll need to cite the comment like this:

> Shuri said, \[a summary or direct quotation of what Shuri said goes
> here\] (*Vibranium Today*, 4:33 -- 5:01).

*Podcast Episode Analysis Writing (Content):*

Your analysis must include all the elements below.

8.  **Quote** a central *normative* claim that is made by someone in the
    episode.

    - A **normative** claim can be a claim by someone in the episode
      that a particular norm, principle, or standard is correct,
      relevant, or applicable. For example, a speaker might argue that a
      particular technology-related practice or policy is *right* or
      *wrong*; or that people who attack others online are doing
      something *valuable*, *admirable*, or *awful*; or that tech
      developers *must be held accountable* to communities who are
      harmed by the tech that's being developed; or that putting more
      automated vehicles on the roads *should be done*, or *should be
      avoided*, or *should be heavily regulated*. (Rest assured that in
      EVERY episode of these podcasts, one or more of the speakers is
      making at least one normative claim!)

9.  **Quote** the premises of the argument that that speaker (or someone
    else in the episode) provides to support that normative claim. What
    seem to be the main premises of the argument? In other words: what
    kinds of evidence or reasons are given to support the normative
    claim?

10. **Succinctly evaluate** the argument(s). You do that FIRST by
    putting the argument into premise-conclusion form, and THEN by
    applying the ARG (Acceptability, Relevance, Adequate Grounds)
    criteria:

    - Are **all** the reasons that are given in support of that
      normative claim actually true, or at least *acceptable*? Explain.
      (For instance, if my evidence for the claim that "kids don't care
      enough about privacy" is the assertion, "kids today post every
      little detail about their lives on social media", then my argument
      is bad because the premise, "kids today post every little detail
      about their lives", is false!)

    - Are **all** the reasons given in support of the normative claim
      *relevant* to that claim/topic? Explain in 1 or 2 sentences at
      most.

    - Collectively (not individually!), do the reasons given in support
      of the normative claim provide *adequate* *grounds* for accepting
      that claim? Explain. (For instance, EVEN IF "kids today" posted
      every little detail about their lives on social media, and EVEN IF
      "kids today" openly discuss their mental health, would that
      strongly support the conclusion they clearly don't care about
      privacy? No. Maybe "kids today" post a lot, openly discuss their
      mental health, AND care a lot about privacy, but they understand
      *privacy* differently from how their grumpy critics understand
      it.)

    - So far, you have evaluated only the *argument* for the normative
      claim. But even if the speaker has given a bad argument to support
      the claim, the claim itself might still be true! So now, discuss
      the normative claim itself. Suppose that it's true: are there
      unpalatable, unpleasant, disturbing, or otherwise bad implications
      of accepting the claim? (For example, suppose it's true that "kids
      don't care enough about privacy". So what? Does that imply that we
      should *make* them care more about it?)

# **Concluding Assignment -- project paper (due 9p Wednesday 23 April) OR viva voce (during exam period 17 - 23 April)**

Option 1: Viva Voce: ***Only those who've received a "High Pass" on at
least 1 Reading Response AND on the Podcast Analysis are eligible to
choose this option**.*

I'll give you a list of 10 questions that will connect different themes,
approaches, and questions from the course. At the viva, I'll arbitrarily
pick some of those questions to ask you, and you'll answer them aloud,
providing elaboration or clarification as needed. You may bring one
sheet of paper with notes, but cannot bring any of the course materials.
The viva will take up to an hour.

Option 2: Project Paper (**this is the default concluding assignment**):
In 2500 -- 5000 words, write a report that gives **a design analysis of
a particular technology of your choosing (subject to my prior review),
in a particular context, in the light of particular ethical values and
perspectives, including some that might be in conflict**. You will focus
on a technology whose features and use, *in a particular context*, raise
concerns related to ethical values and considerations that we have
explored (such as dignity; privacy; well-being; refusal; virtues;
autonomy; democratic governance).

Your report will articulate *and defend* a recommendation (or a set of
recommendations) that "balances" those ethical values and
considerations. What is essential is (a) that your report make a
persuasive argument for whatever you recommend, by (b) drawing on the
relevant course materials and (c) showing that your recommendations
"balance" or "reconcile" the ethical considerations (or other
considerations) that your report raises.

***How To Write A Project Paper For This Course***

Your report must include all the following components:

A.  **Introduction:** In one paragraph at most, provide a brief overview
    of the issue as well as your conclusions and suggestions.

B.  **Context description**: In two or three paragraphs, describe the
    technological artifact (the "technology") that you are analyzing in
    context -- including the problem(s) that it is intended to solve,
    the contexts in which it's intended to be used and/or is actually
    used, the relevant stakeholders who are *affected* by the technology
    (whether they *use* it or not), and some of those stakeholders'
    values, including ethical values.

C.  **Supporting Considerations (for):** In 1 -- 2 paragraphs, provide a
    VALID ethical argument *supporting* the use of that technology *in
    the context you're focusing on.* **The argument must fit at least
    one of the four validating argument forms**. It should make clear
    which values might support or justify using that technology in that
    context. (See the general note, below.)

    - First, construct an argument with 3 -- 8 premises, **including at
      least one normative premise**, **using one or more of the
      validating argument forms**. Write the argument **in
      premise-conclusion form, with each premise on its own line and the
      conclusion on its own line**. Remember that a premise and a
      conclusion each state a *single* idea. A compound sentence, such
      as, "We need better laws and better enforcement so that we can be
      secure, and to protect the vulnerable" is actually making two
      *different* claims, and must be treated as two separate
      statements: "We need better laws and better enforcement so that we
      can be secure"; "We need better laws and better enforcement in
      order to protect the vulnerable".

    - Second, for each premise, explain in 1 -- 2 sentences at most how
      you know that it is **relevant**.

    - (Examine your argument very carefully, to be sure that it fits one
      or more of the validating argument forms! If it doesn't, then
      repeat the previous two steps as often as needed.)

D.  **Opposing considerations (against): ** In 1 -- 2 paragraphs,
    provide a VALID ethical argument *opposing* the use of the
    technology *in that specific context*. **The argument must fit at
    least one of the four validating argument forms**. It should make
    clear which values might oppose using that technology in that
    context. (That opposition might not arise for every stakeholder; you
    can point out different potential ethical issues for different
    stakeholders.  Also, see the general note below.)

    - First, construct an argument with 3 -- 8 premises, **including at
      least one normative premise, using one or more of the validating
      argument forms**. Write the argument **in premise-conclusion form,
      with each premise on its own line and the conclusion on its own
      line**. Remember that a premise and a conclusion each state a
      *single* idea. A compound sentence, such as, "We need better laws
      and better enforcement so that we can be secure, and to protect
      the vulnerable" is actually making two *different* claims, and
      must be treated as two separate statements: "We need better laws
      and better enforcement so that we can be secure"; "We need better
      laws and better enforcement in order to protect the vulnerable".

    - Second, for each premise, explain in 1 -- 2 sentences at most how
      you know that it is **relevant**.

    - (Examine your argument very carefully, to be sure that it is
      valid! If it isn't, then repeat the previous two steps as often as
      needed.)

E.  **Moments of Truth (1 -- 2 pages):** Now you have constructed two
    different valid arguments **for conclusions that directly contradict
    each other**. That means that although they can both be valid, *they
    cannot, by definition, both be sound*. At least one of them **must**
    be unsound -- maybe they both are! -- but probably still contains
    important insights or gives voice to important values. In 1 -- 2
    pages, first *explain* which premises in the "for" argument are true
    (or at worst acceptable), and *explain* which premises in the
    "against" argument are true/acceptable.

F.   **Integrated policy proposal (3 -- 4 pages):** On the basis of
    where you ended step E, you should now articulate *and defend* a
    policy recommendation, in 3 -- 4 pages, that tries to integrate
    and/or balance the ethical considerations that you developed and
    explored in steps C and D. Your policy recommendation can be quite
    broad ("allowable/forbidden for anyone anytime and anywhere"), quite
    narrow ("allowable/forbidden only for such-and-such users under
    such-and-such conditions in such-and-such contexts and when
    such-and-such features are added"), or somewhere between. No matter
    your recommendation, it must *clearly and persuasively* show how it
    reconciles the different considerations that you examined in steps
    C, D, and E. That also means that **in this section, you must raise
    and then respond to a possible objection that someone might make to
    your proposal**.

***General notes: *** Throughout, your paper must explicitly draw on and
engage with our readings and with some of the ethical tools that they
provide. That includes values such as those described in all three of
the course texts, including creativity; dignity; privacy; environmental
stewardship; well-being; fairness; meaning; etc*.* *Explain* clearly how
they're defined, *show* their relevance to your arguments, and provide
citations to the readings.

Your paper can't engage with every single concept we learned or
discussed! But it must draw from and show thoughtful engagement with the
course materials and concepts that are most relevant to your topic.

**Case Study Writing (Mechanics):**

1\. Use a font size between 10 and 12 points, with line spacing of
either 1.5 or double-space.

2\. Your report should be between 2500 and 5000 words. Include your
name(s) in the document, but that doesn't count towards the word total.

3\. Don't make a title page for your report.

4\. Don't use subjectless grammatical constructions that hide agency and
responsibility. For example, a phrase such as, "it will be argued
that..." hides the fact that is a specific someone who is making and
presenting the argument: you! Instead, write, "I will argue that..."

5\. In addition to using the assigned course materials (which is not
optional), you have the option to use up to six (6) external sources --
be they texts, videos, or audio -- as additional resources. An
"external" source is one that wasn't assigned for this course.

6\. Your essay must include a bibliography that lists *all* your
sources, including material from this course.

7\. **You must use in-line citations any time you are either directly
quoting, or even summarizing, someone else's words**. An in-line
citation includes the author's last name -- or, if that's unknown, the
title of the text -- and the page number or some other clear pointer to
the location of the material being cited. Here is an example of an
in-line citation:

> Vallor highlights humans' inability accurately to predict the societal
> and environmental consequences of new technologies. She calls that
> inability, "technosocial opacity" (Vallor, p. 6).

(If you make subsequent references to the same text/material, you don't
need to keep including the author's name; you can just include the page
numbers!)

8\. Your paper must explicitly acknowledge/credit anyone with whom you
discussed your ideas, or from whom you received help (excepting the
instructor of this course!).

9\. You may use a generative model to help you put EITHER the "pro"
argument OR the "con" argument into one of the validating argument
forms, but you of course have the final responsibility for ensuring that
both of those arguments really do fit one/some of the validating
argument forms! **Review the syllabus discussion of the use of
generative models to write or aid in the writing of assignments. Submit
the Generative Model Citation Worksheet along with your paper if
needed.**

9\. You and one (but only one) of your classmates in this section of the
course may co-write your paper. There are many risks and pitfalls, but
also many benefits, of co-writing something. Talk with me **before**
choosing this!

**Your paper must get a "High Pass" or "Pass" in order to get credit for
the assignment.** It does that only if it meets all the criteria below.

+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **High Pass**  | **Your report follows all the stated format, structure,    |
|                | and citation requirements listed section above. It shows   |
|                | clear evidence of careful editing and proofreading,        |
|                | containing almost no typographical, spelling, or           |
|                | grammatical problems. The report is intentionally written  |
|                | to be clear and compelling reading.**                      |
|                |                                                            |
|                | **The bulk of the report develops the argument for its     |
|                | thesis, clearly presenting the writer's "voice", rather    |
|                | than merely summarizing others' arguments and points. The  |
|                | report incorporates others' material for support or        |
|                | illustration, only as much as necessary, and not as a      |
|                | substitute for an independent perspective or viewpoint.    |
|                | Summaries are charitable, show a *strong* grasp on the     |
|                | material being summarized, and demonstrate awareness of    |
