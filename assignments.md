# What kinds of assignments will we have in this course?

The assignments are listed below and described more fully in a separate
document ("Course Assignments"). That document is also part of the
syllabus. Research about learning strongly suggests[^2] that the most
important factor in learning is doing the work of practicing, recalling,
synthesizing, and analyzing. The assignments are designed to help with
that.

1. First week reflection

1. Writing Assignments: Reading Responses (2), Podcast Analysis (1)

1. Socratic Circle memos (10)

1. Prep document annotations (20)

1. In-Class activities (ICAs) (20)
