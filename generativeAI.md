## (How) can you and I use generative "AI" in this class?

Different courses call for different approaches to the use of different
technological systems, both for instructors and for students.

I don't use generative AI in this course for many reasons, including
some that I explain below.
- I don't use it in my correspondence with you.
- I don't use it to produce my notes or class material or to summarize
that material.
- I don't use it to "read", review, or assess anything that
you submit.
- I don't use so-called "AI detectors" to check the work that
you submit.

Given my goals for *this* course, **you should not use generative
AI-based software for any assignments, whether graded or ungraded, for
which you expect to receive credit**.

Here is the rationale for my policies. I welcome your questions. If
you\'re finding yourself confused about whether you\'re \"allowed\" to
use certain tools or to use them in certain ways, then please talk with
me *first* -- during class, appointment hours, or email!

- *Temporarily* setting aside the extractive mindsets and practices that
underpin the creation of large-scale AI systems, you have to check and
possibly fix their outputs. You can't do that without the relevant
skills and knowledge of the topic areas. But what makes you a learner in
this course is precisely the fact that you *don't* already have those
skills and that knowledge! You're learning how to think and write like a
(certain kind of) philosopher about particular questions, not how to
*generate text* that looks and sounds "philosophical". Generative AI
systems could be useful for achieving that second result, but are often
detrimental to achieving the first one. And the first one is the one
that I care about as the course instructor.

- In a 2024 article, the author Ted Chiang claims that "using
\[generative AI\] to complete assignments is like bringing a forklift
into the weight room; you will never improve your...fitness that
way".[^1] [The point of a weight room isn't to move weights in
any old way. It's to develop your strength and endurance, by developing
your ability to move weights under your own power. There are certainly
places where we need to use forklifts, but the weight room isn't that
place!

- The course assignments' job is to strengthen your philosophical
abilities and to help your classmates strengthen theirs. As such,
they're like lifting weights in order to develop your strength. My goal
for you in this course is not that you produce writing in any old way.
It's to develop your ability to trust yourself as someone capable of
expressing your own interesting and complex thoughts in writing. There
are places where generative AI could be useful to produce writing, but
they're useless for the kind of writing that I want you to undertake in
this course, because *that* writing is a result of your thinking hard
about questions that matter. Take a moment to ask *why it is* that so
many educational institutions are being encouraged to adopt tools whose
main use threatens the learning of the foundational skills that they say
they value!

**For all the cases below, you need to complete the Generative Model
Citation Worksheet and include it with your submission**.

**Using generative models on any of the other course assignments is an academic
integrity violation and, likely, self-defeating.** I won't go out of my way to try
to stop you from defeating yourself, but that doesn't mean I'm indifferent!

1.  Only as a last resort, and a competent person isn't around, you may
    use a generative model for grammatical corrections, and for help
    with English translation from a different natural language, *to
    things you have **already** written*.

2.  You may use generative models during any class meetings where the
    in-class activity involves using generative models.

3.  You may use generative models on the concluding assignment, only as
    designated in the instructions for that assignment.
