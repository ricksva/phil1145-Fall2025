**Generative Model Citation Worksheet**

**Instructions: If you used a generative model in completing one of
the eligible assignments, then you need to turn in this worksheet with that
assignment. You must also include citations in your paper; see below.**

1.  What is the "problem" you wanted a generative model to help you
    solve? (For example, you felt that you needed it to: help you
    translate your words into English; or construct a valid argument out
    of premises that you provide; or construct a valid argument out of a
    conclusion that you provide; or satisfy your curiosity about what
    might happen; other)

2.  What had you already written on your own, without using any
    generative model?

3.  Which model did you use (provide the model name and number, which
    might require some effort on your part to find)?

4.  When did you use it (provide the date or dates)?

5.  What inputs ("prompts") did you provide?

6.  How did you evaluate the outputs? How did you check them for
    accuracy or helpfulness? What alterations did you have to make? (For
    example: for reasons *intrinsic to their structure*, generative
    models are hilariously bad at generating valid arguments, and you'll
    have to fix whatever they come up with.)

7.  What did you learn from your use of the generative model? (Things
    you learned about your attitude to writing or coming up with
    arguments; about your assumptions about the usefulness of generative
    models for assignments like this one; other)

8.  What do you want me, the person assigning you this assignment, to
    know about your use of a generative model with this assignment? What
    should I take into consideration for next time -- either about
    students' uses of generative models in this course, or about my own?

**How to cite the model itself (do this for
*each* of the *models* that you used, NOT for each *occasion* of use):**

The basic citation format looks like this:

Author/Developer. (Year). *Model name* (Version) \[Large language
model\]. URL

**Example:** MistralAI. (2024). *Mistral* (beta version) \[Large
language model\]. https://chat.mistral.ai/chat
