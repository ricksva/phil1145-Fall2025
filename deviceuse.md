## Which electronic devices may I use during class?

We sometimes use phones, tablets, and laptops in class as part of an activity (such as taking
**collaborative** notes or looking things up.
But the default policy is that those devices need to be silenced and put away during class time.
If you want to use a device throughout the course, then email me a device proposal with your intended usage.

## What is a "Device Proposal"?

The following is an actual example from a former student:

"I am reading through the syllabus and would like to ask for your permission to use my laptop
computer during class, when necessary for note-taking.

The reasons I would prefer to use my device instead of a pen/pencil and paper are listed below:

I use a really handy notes application on my device.
Since I have owned a laptop and used it in most classes, I realized I am more likely to review
my notes when they are on a screen than on papers.
I noticed that when my notes are handwritten, I am more likely to rewrite my notes at home
out of frustration with its lack of neatness during lectures. (I do not write quickly.)
I can easily fix mistakes on my notes and I like to add links from readings or other online assignments.
I know many professors worry about how easily some students can get distracted and I understand,
but I have kept attention in all my classes and find it very disrespectful to be off-task, thus it
is very unlikely for me to be off-task.
My laptop is very lightweight and much easier for me to bring along on my walks around campus to get to classes.

How I can help others:

I am always willing to share my notes through email or a shared document with classmates and/or my professors.
I date all of my notes and label them based on the topic or chapter of the day so hopefully anyone can understand.
I can turn my brightness down to avoid distraction
I also turn my laptop on mute to avoid disturbances
My laptop (surface pro 4) has a decent camera and with your permission I can take snapshots of
any other form of presentation and insert the image on the document page in my notes app."
