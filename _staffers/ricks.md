## Who are you?

At Northeastern, I'm a Teaching Professor of Philosophy (in the College of Social Sciences and Humanities) and Computer Science
(in Khoury College of Computing Sciences). You can call me "Vance" or "Professor Ricks", in that order
of preference. I teach philosophy courses and I work with other Khoury
faculty to incorporate the teaching of ethical concepts into the
Computer Science curriculum.

This is the start of my 5th year at
Northeastern. My undergraduate and doctoral degrees are in Philosophy,
and my focus in graduate school was on friendship and theory of action
(ask me about it sometime!). During and after college, and before
graduate school, I was a technical writer and computer programmer at
IBM. I think and write about the ethical implications of digital
technologies, among other topics. I also have a variety of tremendously
fascinating pastimes and interests.
