## What's this course about?

This course treats technological systems (such as social media tools,
"surveillance tech", and artificial intelligence systems) as **tools for
exploring questions in ethics and in philosophy more broadly**. Our
answers to those questions have implications for whether and how we
should design, make, use, understand, and respond to technologies and
technological systems. The course uses various philosophical concepts
and tools, developed within a variety of intellectual and cultural
traditions.

This course asks: How *should* our moral and political values shape --
and be shaped by -- our technologies? How can we best achieve
technologies' promises, while preventing, minimizing, or more fairly
distributing their harms? We can't answer those questions without
noticing that our technologies embody various philosophical and
sociopolitical choices about things like *well-being*, *autonomy*,
*health*, and *meaning*. This course is, fundamentally, about those
things.

## What will I get from this course?

Like most philosophy courses, this one involves "thinking in slow
motion": taking everyday and often-unquestioned ideas, practices, and
values, and examining them creatively, carefully, and thoughtfully.
That's sometimes called "critical thinking", but *every* academic
discipline can teach you critical thinking! Philosophy is critical
thinking freed of several of the boundaries that define other
disciplines. You'll get better at that.

**The course's *general* goals are (a) to introduce you to ethical and
sociopolitical implications of some technologies and (b) to show you how
to apply philosophical thinking to your (and others') responses to those
implications.** You should be able to:

- **Demonstrate** orally and in writing your understanding of
  philosophical questions raised by and related to topics such as
  privacy, attention, and artificial intelligence

- Clearly and accurately **explain** important philosophical and
  ethical concepts, such as normativity, well-being, autonomy, and moral
  virtues

- Accurately and charitably **summarize and analyze** others' arguments
  for their presuppositions, strength, consistency, and
  implications

- **Make** **and** **improve** your own thoughtful, well-supported, and
  clearly expressed perspectives on the ethical and sociopolitical
  dimensions of technologies

- **Engage** your classmates, instructor, and others in thoughtful and
  constructive discussions about the philosophy of technology

- **Apply** what you have learned in this course to your life as a
  member of a society that designs, uses, and is affected by all kinds
  of technologies.

## Who are you?

I'm a Teaching Professor of Philosophy (in CSSH) and Computer Science
(in Khoury). You can call me "Vance" or "Professor Ricks", in that order
of preference. I teach philosophy courses and I work with other Khoury
faculty to incorporate the teaching of ethical concepts into the
Computer Science curriculum.

This is the start of my 5th year at
Northeastern. My undergraduate and doctoral degrees are in Philosophy,
and my focus in graduate school was on friendship and theory of action
(ask me about it sometime!). During and after college, and before
graduate school, I was a technical writer and computer programmer at
IBM. I think and write about the ethical implications of digital
technologies, among other topics. I also have a variety of tremendously
fascinating pastimes and interests.

## I need to talk with you. How do I reach you?

You can send email to me at
[v.ricks@northeastern.edu](mailto:v.ricks@northeastern.edu).
Before 8pm, usually I respond within a couple of hours. (Later than
that, and on weekends, don't expect a reply until the following
morning.) If you'd like to talk about a philosophical matter, then it's
better to make an appointment; email isn't well suited for that kind of
conversation!

I have appointment hours \[**Mon/Tue/Fri 12:00p - 1p; otherwise by
appointment\] in Renaissance Park room 432 -- NOT the parking garage,
but the multistory building next to the Ruggles T stop and near
International Village**.

Appointment hours are for you to talk with me
about our course or about anything else on your mind. You can sign up to
reserve a time through Calendly
(<https://calendly.com/v-ricks/ricks-fall-2025-student-appointment-hours>).
**When you sign up, indicate whether you'd rather meet in person, on
Teams, or on zoom.**

If my hours conflict with your schedule, then
please talk with me to find an alternative time!

## What if we read or discuss uncomfortable topics?

This course addresses emotionally and socially charged topics: our
design and uses of technologies! Reading about or discussing those
topics might present ideas or situations that you find distressing --
such as suffering, manipulation, and forms of bigotry or oppression. So
you might find some readings, images, and language discomfiting. ut
sometimes we can best understand an issue, and each other's views, only
by being willing to face and understand distressing things. Seeing such
challenges as chances for growth can be one way to help yourself face
whatever discomfort you feel during the course. I also encourage you to
talk with me and/or the TA about your experiences in the course.

## What are the course texts and other materials?

Buy the PRINT editions of these texts (either from the campus bookstore
in the Curry Student Center, or elsewhere). We'll use the PRINT
editions, not the ebook editions, of these books. **If buying them will
be a financial hardship, then please talk to me right away.** ALWAYS
bring the materials that were assigned for that day's class, to that
day's class!

1.  _Ethics for people who work in tech_, Marc Steen
    (paperback, CRC Press 2023)

2.  _The Right To Oblivion_, Lowry Pressly (Harvard
    University Press 2024)

3.  _How to Do Nothing_, Jenny Odell (paperback, Melville
    House 2019)

4.  Other readings and materials given as printed handouts or on the
    course Canvas site

5.  A paper notebook or notepad, dedicated to use in this
    course

6.  A good, English-language dictionary -- STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

## What other stuff do I need to have for this course?

If you have a copy of the required course texts; a reliable and strong
Internet connection; a tablet/computer for accessing Canvas, email, and
web sites; and something to write on and write with during class, then
you have the material stuff that you need!

## How much time will I need to devote to this course?

There is tension between some people's expectations that an intro-level
course should be "easier" and the reality that it's still a
4-credit-hour course. This course meets for a bit more than 3
instructional hours per week for 13 weeks. **The university's general
guideline for such a course, regardless of the level, is that you spend
2 hours on course-related work (including reading) outside of class for
every 1 hour you spend in class.**

That's what's typical, not a
requirement. However, the course readings and assignments might require
more time than you expect, so your results might vary.

## What should I do BEFORE our class meetings? 

- **Don't come to class if you don't feel well or have recently
  tested positive for covid-19**, and please wear a mask to class during
  the first week of the semester. (The university forbids faculty from
  *requiring* masks, but I'm *asking* that you wear one during that time
  and whenever else you want to. Airborne viruses, unfortunately, aren't
  "over".)

  - Make time to read the assigned materials and then read them. Try your
  best to find time when you're awake, alert, and won't be interrupted.
  Don't speed read; go slowly (unless I've specifically suggested that
  you skim). Ty to identify the author's main claims and the reasons and
  examples given to support those claims. Look up unfamiliar words or
  phrases and write their definitions in your notes. If you find that
  your eyes are just passing over the words, then stop and come back
  later.

- Be prepared to read the assigned materials **more than once**. Philosophy
  can be hard to read, so you should expect to be confused about some or
  much of that reading! But don't fall back on, "I have no idea what
  they're saying". Instead, try to figure out why you're confused. Write
  down your questions in your notebook, so that you can come to class
  prepared to discuss them.

- Next, **read the google doc Prep document for that day's class, and
  annotate it where you see fit**. The Prep document is meant to clarify
  the reading and prepare us for a good class meeting. See below for
  more details.

- Next, bring the assigned materials with you to class. Be ready to
  talk together and think together. Before you get to class, do
  something that helps you focus (some light calisthenics, or some
  meditation, or a snack), if at all possible.


## What should I do DURING our class meetings? 

- Arrive on time, stay for the duration, and constructively participate
  in all class activities! Showing up *a few* minutes late sometimes
  happens. Just enter the room quietly -- and please don't ask, "Did I
  miss anything?", because of course you did! If you miss more than half
  of a class period, I'll count you as absent for that day's
  class.

- If *I* am the one who's running late, then I will do my best to let
  you know -- but we *will* still hold class, unless I specifically say
  otherwise or unless more than half of the class period has passed.
  Feel free to start class without me if I'm running late.

- We'll focus on your questions and on activities (e.g., argument
  reconstructions, in-class writing, small-group discussions) designed
  to help us generate new answers and questions. Probably, our class
  meetings will end with us not having reached a definitive answer, and
  wanting to explore more. Sometimes, we'll do that in the next class.
  Other times, we won't be able to do that, but you can make additional
  annotations in the Prep documents or take up the topic in your
  Socratic Circle meetings.

- Avoid doing or interacting with things that will distract you or your
  classmates. **If any of your digital devices plays a tune or does anything else
  audibly or visually distracting during class time, then you have to bring doughnuts
  to the next class meeting.** (Am I serious about this?)

- DO NOT make any audiovisual recordings of any part of the class
  session unless you and I have specifically discussed doing so as one
  of your documented accommodations for ADA purposes. Doing otherwise
  undermines the ability to maintain your classmates' trust, violates
  your classmates' legitimate privacy expectations, and could lead to
  their feeling (or even being) unsafe. Unless your classmates and I
  have explicitly said otherwise, you DO NOT have permission to take
  photos or screen captures, livestream the class meetings, or
  audiovisually record any part of a class meeting.

- Treat everyone in the class with at least as much patience, respect,
  and kindness as you expect from the rest of us. Express agreement, and
  disagreement, unapologetically and considerately. Don't focus on
  trying to sound smart, win the conversation, or always have the last
  word. Instead, help discern what is likely to be true or what is
  definitely false. That discernment requires that we all be open to
  revising or even retracting our claims, so that we can arrive at more
  insightful and action-guiding views.

## Which electronic devices may I use during class?

We sometimes use phones, tablets, and laptops in class as part of an activity (such as taking
**collaborative** notes or looking things up.
But the default policy is that _those devices need to be silenced and put away during class time_.
If you want to use a device in class, then email me a device proposal with your intended usage.

### What is a "Device Proposal"?

The following is an actual example from a former student:

> "I am reading through the syllabus and would like to ask for your permission to use my laptop
> computer during class, when necessary for note-taking.
>
> The reasons I would prefer to use my device instead of a pen/pencil and paper are listed below:
>
> * I use a really handy notes application on my device.
> * Since I have owned a laptop and used it in most classes, I realized I am more likely to review
>   my notes when they are on a screen than on paper.
> * I noticed that when my notes are handwritten, I am more likely to rewrite my notes at home
>   out of frustration with its lack of neatness during lectures. (I do not write quickly.)
> * I can easily fix mistakes on my notes and I like to add links from readings or other online assignments.
> * I know many professors worry about how easily some students can get distracted, and I understand,
>   but I have kept attention in all my classes and find it very disrespectful to be off-task, thus it
>   is very unlikely for me to be off-task.
> * My laptop is very lightweight and much easier for me to bring along on my walks around campus to get to classes.
>
> How I can help others:
>
> - I am always willing to share my notes through email or a shared document with classmates and/or my professors. I date all
>   of my notes and label them based on the topic or chapter of the day so hopefully anyone can understand.
> - I can turn my brightness down to avoid distraction
> - I also turn my laptop on mute to avoid disturbances
> - My laptop (surface pro 4) has a decent camera and with your permission I can take snapshots of
>   any other form of presentation and insert the image on the document page in my notes app."


## What kinds of support are available to help me succeed?

First, **remember that Northeastern wouldn't have admitted you if they
didn't think that you could succeed here**. In addition to me, there are
people and resources to help any Northeastern student who could benefit
from them. For example:

***You have a disability or other source of need***: For people who
qualify under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Northeastern
facilitates and supports the implementation of reasonable
accommodations, including resources and services for students with
documented disabilities, chronic medical conditions, temporary
disabilities, or pregnancy complications resulting in difficulties with
accessing learning opportunities. **You don't have to disclose any
disabilities or impairments to me unless you wish to receive
accommodations for them**. See the Disability Access Service's website
for information about requests for academic accommodations:
[https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu](https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu)

***You'd like to confidentially discuss your health (including mental
health)***: If you or someone you know would like to discuss
confidential information about health (including mental health), contact
Northeastern's Health and Counseling Services at
([http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/counseling-services/](http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/counseling-services/))
or We Care
([http://www.northeastern.edu/wecare/](http://www.northeastern.edu/wecare/)).

***You or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted***:
Northeastern's Title IX Policy prohibits Prohibited Offenses, which are
defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship or domestic
violence, and stalking. The policy applies to all students, faculty, and
staff. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you
can always get *confidential* support and guidance from University
Health and Counseling Services staff
([http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/](http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/))
and the Center for Spiritual Dialogue and Service clergy members
([http://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/](http://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/)).
You can report alleged violations *non-confidentially* to the Title IX
Coordinator within The Office for Gender Equity and Compliance
([titleix@northeastern.edu](mailto:titleix@northeastern.edu))
and/or through NUPD (Emergency 617.373.3333; Non-Emergency
617.373.2121). Reporting Prohibited Offenses to NUPD does *not* commit
the victim/affected party to future legal action.

> **Note**: As a faculty member, I am considered a "responsible
> employee" at Northeastern University. **That means that I'm legally
> required to report all allegations of race-, sex-, or gender-based
> discrimination to the university's Title IX Coordinator**.

You can find a complete list of reporting options and resources, both
on- and off-campus, at
[www.northeastern.edu/titleix](http://www.northeastern.edu/titleix).

***You or someone you know has been unfairly discriminated against***:
The Office for University Equity and Compliance is responsible
for investigating complaints of discrimination. Any member of the
Northeastern community who believes that they have been discriminated
against should report the incident promptly through the [On-Line
Discrimination Complaint
Form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?NortheasternUniv&layout_id=7) ([https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/reporting-options/discrimination/](https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/reporting-options/discrimination/))
which exists to assist the complainant in formulating a concise
statement of their allegations and goes directly to the Office for
University Equity and Compliance.

***You need an accommodation because of religious observances***: If you
cannot attend class, participate in required course activities, or take
a scheduled exam because of religious observances, then I will give you
a reasonable opportunity to make up the course work without penalty. You
can find the university policy on religious observance at
[http://www.northeastern.edu/policies/pdfs/Policy_on_Instructional_Accommodations_for_Student_Religious_Observance_rsa1.pdf](http://www.northeastern.edu/policies/pdfs/Policy_on_Instructional_Accommodations_for_Student_Religious_Observance_rsa1.pdf).

***You'd like tutoring services***: Northeastern's peer tutoring program
([https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/peer-tutoring/](https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/peer-tutoring/))
is free and open to all NU undergraduate students.

***You're an international student and would like tutoring or other
support***: Northeastern's International Tutoring Center (ITC) -
[https://international.northeastern.edu/gss/](https://international.northeastern.edu/gss/) -
gives Northeastern's international students free, comprehensive English
language and academic support. The ITC includes English as a Second
Language Tutoring (ESL), Language and Culture Workshops, and Reading
Workshops.

***You'd like to get general help with research materials***: [Snell
Library](https://library.northeastern.edu/) offers a
variety of resources for undergraduate research, including
subject-specific [Research
Guides](https://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/?b=g&d=a), help
with citation and bibliography, and round-the-clock chat support.

***You'd like to get general help strengthening your writing***: Visit
the NU Writing Center:
[http://www.northeastern.edu/writingcenter/](http://www.northeastern.edu/writingcenter/).

***You have a concern about this course***: Please first start by
talking with me! Although it might feel uncomfortable or even scary to
do that, I'd like the chance to hear and address your concerns. If that
doesn't help, then you can contact the chairperson of the
Philosophy/Religion department, Prof. Rory Smead. For information about
formal academic appeals policies and procedures, see the 2024-25
Undergraduate Student Handbook at
[https://admissions.northeastern.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/](https://admissions.northeastern.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/).

## What if I miss a class?

I expect you to attend as many class meetings as possible. However, you
might sometimes have to be absent, for any number of reasons. If you
need to miss class:

- You **do not** need to contact me in advance!

- **NEVER** ask me any version of, "Did I miss anything important?" --
  of course you did...

- Make time to discuss that day's materials with me. I don't record the
  class meetings, but I'm happy to answer your questions, and you can
  also annotate that day's Prep document or ask to see your classmates'
  notes.

- **You won't be able to make up any In-Class Activity assignment from
  that day's class**, but you are still responsible for making
  arrangements to submit any *other* assignments that were due that
  day.

**If I need to miss class**: I will do my best to hold class over Zoom,
rather than canceling class. I'll email you as soon as possible to let
you know about the switch and will send the link so that we can still
hold class that way. If that's unfeasible, then I'll notify the class as
soon as possible and will plan an alternative activity for you.

## Can I cheat in this class?

In the sense of "can" that refers to what's metaphysically possible,
sure. But you already know that cheating is unethical and that it
undermines the foundations of your education. To foster individual and
communal academic integrity, Northeastern subscribes to the principles
of an academic integrity policy. I presume that any work that you hand
in under your own name -- even if it's a draft -- has followed that
policy. *If you find that you can't say that about something that you
have submitted, let me know immediately*.

Also, **why** do you want to cheat? If it's because you're feeling
deadling pressure, then cheating is a *really bad* way to address that
fear! Instead, check the late work policy for this course, below. If you
still decide that you need to cheat on something, then I'll treat that
work as if you hadn't submitted it at all. That means you get no credit
for having done the assignment, and I notify the Office of Student
Conduct and Conflict Resolution about the violation. If that happens
more than once, then you'll fail the course.

**Your Responsibility to the Academic Integrity Policy** -- In short:
you can't claim that someone else's words or ideas are yours; you can't
use unauthorized materials or resources; you can't do things to try to
gain unfair advantages over your classmates; and you can't work with
other people unless I say you can. To see Northeastern's full Academic
Honesty and Integrity Policy, go to
[https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/](https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/).

## (How) can you and I use generative "AI" in this class?

Different courses call for different approaches to the use of different
technological systems, both for instructors and for students.

I don't use generative AI in this course for many reasons, including
some that I explain below. I don't use it in my correspondence with you.
I don't use it to produce my notes or class material or to summarize
that material. I don't use it to "read", review, or assess anything that
you submit. I don't use so-called "AI detectors" to check the work that
you submit.

Given my goals for *this* course, **you should not use generative
AI-based software for any assignments, whether graded or ungraded, for
which you expect to receive credit**.

Here is the rationale for my policies. I welcome your questions. If
you\'re finding yourself confused about whether you\'re \"allowed\" to
use certain tools or to use them in certain ways, then please talk with
me *first* -- during class, appointment hours, or email!

*Temporarily* setting aside the extractive mindsets and practices that
underpin the creation of large-scale AI systems, you have to check and
possibly fix their outputs. You can't do that without the relevant
skills and knowledge of the topic areas. But what makes you a learner in
this course is precisely the fact that you *don't* already have those
skills and that knowledge! You're learning how to think and write like a
(certain kind of) philosopher about particular questions, not how to
*generate text* that looks and sounds "philosophical". Generative AI
systems could be useful for achieving that second result, but are often
detrimental to achieving the first one. And the first one is the one
that I care about as the course instructor.

In a 2024 article, the author Ted Chiang claims that "using
\[generative AI\] to complete assignments is like bringing a forklift
into the weight room; you will never improve your...fitness that
way".]{.mark}[^1] [The point of a weight room isn't to move weights in
any old way. It's to develop your strength and endurance, by developing
your ability to move weights under your own power. There are certainly
places where we need to use forklifts, but the weight room isn't that
place!

The course assignments' job is to strengthen your philosophical
abilities and to help your classmates strengthen theirs. As such,
they're like lifting weights in order to develop your strength. My goal
for you in this course is not that you produce writing in any old way.
It's to develop your ability to trust yourself as someone capable of
expressing your own interesting and complex thoughts in writing. There
are places where generative AI could be useful to produce writing, but
they're useless for the kind of writing that I want you to undertake in
this course, because *that* writing is a result of your thinking hard
about questions that matter. Take a moment to ask *why it is* that so
many educational institutions are being encouraged to adopt tools whose
main use threatens the learning of the foundational skills that they say
they value!

**For all the cases below, you need to complete the Generative Model
Citation Worksheet and include it with your submission**. **Using
generative models on any of the other course assignments is an academic
integrity violation and, likely, self-defeating.** I won't go out of my
way to try to stop you, but that doesn't mean I'm indifferent!

1.  Only as a last resort, and a competent person isn't around, you may
    use a generative model for grammatical corrections, and for help
    with English translation from a different natural language, *to
    things you have **already** written*.

2.  You may use generative models during any class meetings where the
    in-class activity involves using generative models.

3.  You may use generative models on the concluding assignment, only as
    designated in the instructions for that assignment.

## What kinds of assignments will we have in this course?

The assignments are listed below and described more fully in a separate
document ("Course Assignments"). That document is also part of the
syllabus. Research about learning strongly suggests[^2] that the most
important factor in learning is doing the work of practicing, recalling,
synthesizing, and analyzing. The assignments are designed to help with
that.

> 1\. First week reflection
>
> 2\. Writing Assignments: Reading Responses (2), Podcast Analysis (1)
>
> 4\. Socratic Circle memos (10)
>
> 5\. Prep document annotations (20)
>
> 6\. In-Class activities (ICAs) (20)
>
> 7\. Concluding Assignment (Project Paper or Viva)

## How will you evaluate/grade my work?

Each assignment has its own criteria of adequacy that are included with
the assignment description. Your work gets a grade of "Complete/Pass"
only if it meets ***all*** the criteria of adequacy for that assignment.
Otherwise, it gets a grade of "Incomplete/Fail". Those are the only
possible assignment grades, and there is no such thing as "partial"
credit.

So, for instance, if there are **three** things that your assignment
needs to do in order to receive a "Complete/Pass", but your assignment
does only **two** of those things, your assignment doesn't receive
two-thirds credit. Rather, it receives an "Incomplete/Fail".

**Your overall course grade is based on the number of your assignments
that receive a Complete/Pass.**

This is a form of what is called "specifications grading". It differs
from the number- and letter-grade-based systems that you're likely more
familiar with. I use it because there is good evidence that
specifications grading helps people be better able to focus on learning
and less on getting a particular grade, that it boosts people's
intrinsic motivation, and that it perhaps even helps them understand the
course material more deeply. Please talk with me early on, about any
questions you have about this form of grading!

## Do I get any chances to redo an assignment?

- You may redo the Reading Responses, Podcast Analysis, and Socratic
  Memos. You cannot redo any of the other course assignments (see "Can I
  turn in my work late?" below).

- You start the course with six (6) **nonrenewable** intangible
  resubmission tokens. You "spend" them only to revise and resubmit the
  eligible assignments. In other words: if you get an "Incomplete/Fail"
  on an eligible assignment, then you may use a token. That token gives
  you up to one week -- from the time you receive my feedback on the
  assignment -- to redo, revise, and resubmit the assignment for another
  chance for a passing grade.

- Resubmitting an assignment that you submitted by the original deadline
  "costs" 1 token (if you have any left). Resubmitting an assignment
  that you submitted *after* the original deadline "costs" 2 tokens (if
  you have any left).

- *You may use multiple resubmission tokens on the same assignment*, or
  you can distribute them evenly across the eligible assignments. It's
  your choice.

- **Once you've used your 6 tokens, you can't resubmit/revise eligible
  assignments.**

- **Resubmission tokens are just that: resubmission tokens. They can't
  be "spent" as an alternative to actually submitting an assignment.**

## If the assignments don't have percentages, then how will I know what my overall course grade is?

The table below shows what combination of *passing grades* on the
assignments corresponds to which overall course grade range. Your course
grade will be the highest row that your assignments satisfy *all* the
columns of.

For instance: suppose that you met all the other requirements for a
course grade of "A", but that you passed only 2 out of the 3 writing
assignments (rather than passing the 3 that are required for a course
grade of "A" or "A-"). In that case, your course grade would be a "B+"
at best, because that's the highest row that your assignments satisfy
*all* the columns of.

## When are assignments due?

Most, but not all, out-of-class assignments are due **before 9pm
Eastern Time** (deadlines subject to change):

- Class Attendance ("due" when the class meets!)

- Prep document annotations -- due before 9pm (not am!) the day before
  class

- In-class activities -- due in that day's class

- First-week Reflection -- due Friday 12 September

- Reading Responses -- due Friday 19 September and Friday 17 October

- Podcast Analysis -- due Friday 31 October

- Socratic Circle memos -- due Mondays starting 22 September; Canvas
  page for details

- Concluding Assignment option -- due Monday 08--Wednesday 10 December

## Can I turn in my work late?

**You can't submit the Prep document annotations, In-Class Activities,
or concluding assignment after their deadlines**. Why not?

1.  The Prep document annotations are how your classmates and I see
    which points to focus on *before* and *very shortly after* that
    day's class. Doing them after everyone else doesn't give your
    classmates a chance to respond in a timely way and doesn't help me
    prepare for that day's class.

2.  In-Class Activities are done *in groups in that day's class* and
    are intended to foster small-group work on that day's material
    *during that day's class*. Doing them on your own, and/or after that
    day's class means that you're not interacting with, or learning
    from, your classmates *at the time*.

3.  The Concluding Assignments happen during the last week of the term,
    when there is very little time before I have to submit your course
    grades to the Registrar's office.

**For the Reading Responses, Podcast Episode Analysis, and Socratic
Circle Memos, you get a no-questions-asked deadline extension as
follows:**

1.  **You must notify (not ask; just notify) me BEFORE the original
    deadline**.

2.  You tell me **in writing** that you'll turn in the assignment
    before 9pm Eastern on \[date no later than 5 calendar days after the
    original deadline\].

3.  (For the Responses and Analysis only) You acknowledge, **also**
    **in writing**, that your work will "cost" 2 tokens for revision and
    resubmission. In other words: if you submit an eligible assignment
    after its original deadline, and it doesn't get a passing grade,
    then *you'll need to use 2 tokens (if you have any remaining) in
    order to resubmit it for another chance at a passing grade*. By
    contrast: only if you turn in an assignment by its original
    deadline, then a resubmission/revision "costs" just 1 token, if you
    have any remaining.

4.  You turn in the assignment by the day and time that you told me you
    would. **This is a strict deadline**, so you *must* give yourself a
    large margin of time to account for possible Internet problems,
    computer crashes, travel disruptions, and so on. Don't try to submit
    it less than half an hour before the deadline, or while you're on
    the road, etc.!

**Being late on one assignment doesn't change the due dates of other
assignments**. You might have to work on an upcoming assignment despite
not yet having turned in (or gotten feedback about) an assignment that
was due earlier.

**Extended Extensions**: If you find that you'll need a longer deadline
extension for an assignment because of a serious illness or some
similarly serious situation, then please let me know, as early as
possible.
 

## What should I do if I'm struggling to do an assignment?

*The first thing you should do is reread the assignment directions*.
Make sure you understand what they're asking you to do. If you don't
understand -- or you're not sure whether you understand -- or you do
understand but are still struggling -- then talk with me in class or
*during one of my appointment hours*. Those hours are a great time to
talk about your questions!

## What's the schedule?

**Check our course Canvas site for the most current schedule**. There,
the "What to read before class" link shows what you should have read
before that day's class. Unless I note otherwise, you can find the
assigned pages in the required books.
