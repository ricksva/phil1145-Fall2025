# How will you evaluate/grade my work?

Each assignment has its own criteria of adequacy that are included with
the assignment description. Your work gets a grade of "Complete/Pass"
only if it meets ***all*** the criteria of adequacy for that assignment.
Otherwise, it gets a grade of "Incomplete/Fail". Those are the only
possible assignment grades, and there is no such thing as "partial"
credit.

So, for instance, if there are **three** things that your assignment
needs to do in order to receive a "Complete/Pass", but your assignment
does only **two** of those things, your assignment doesn't receive
two-thirds credit. Rather, it receives an "Incomplete/Fail".

**Your overall course grade is based on the number of your assignments
that receive a Complete/Pass.**

This is a form of what is called ["specifications grading"](https://philarchive.org/archive/VITISL). It differs
from the number- and letter-grade-based systems that you're likely more
familiar with. I use it because there is good evidence that
specifications grading helps people be better able to focus on learning
and less on getting a particular grade, that it boosts people's
intrinsic motivation, and that it perhaps even helps them understand the
course material more deeply. Please talk with me early on, about any
questions you have about this form of grading!

## Do I get any chances to redo an assignment?

- You may redo the Reading Responses, Podcast Analysis, and Socratic
  Memos. You cannot redo any of the other course assignments.

- You start the course with six (6) **nonrenewable** intangible
  resubmission tokens. You "spend" them only to revise and resubmit the
  eligible assignments.

  In other words: if you get an "Incomplete/Fail"
  on an eligible assignment, then you may use a token. That token gives
  you up to one week -- from the time you receive my feedback on the
  assignment -- to redo, revise, and resubmit the assignment for another
  chance for a passing grade.

- Resubmitting an assignment that you submitted by the original deadline
  "costs" 1 token (if you have any left). Resubmitting an assignment
  that you submitted *after* the original deadline "costs" 2 tokens (if
  you have any left).

- *You may use multiple resubmission tokens on the same assignment*, or
  you can distribute them evenly across the eligible assignments. It's
  your choice.

- **Once you've used your 6 tokens, you can't resubmit/revise eligible
  assignments.**

- **Resubmission tokens are just that: REsubmission tokens for an already-submitted assignment. You can't
  use them as an alternative to actually submitting an assignment!**

## If the assignments don't have percentages, then how will I know what my overall course grade is?

The table below shows what combination of *passing grades* on the
assignments corresponds to which overall course grade. Your course
grade will be the highest row that your assignments satisfy *all* the
columns of.

For instance: suppose that you met all the other requirements for a
course grade of "A", but that you passed only 2 out of the 3 writing
assignments (rather than passing the 3 that are required for a course
grade of "A" or "A-"). In that case, your course grade would be a "B+"
at best, because that's the highest row that your assignments satisfy
*all* the columns of.
